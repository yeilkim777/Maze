# Maze Day Color Maze
## How to run
To Play the game, download and extract the files. In the folder, run color_maze.exe.

## Who is it for
Can be played by everyone, but created with low vision individuals who can discern colors and movements in mind. Audios are included to lead players through the game and its mechanics.

## Technologies, Frameworks, and Libraries

## Problems Encountered
We attempted to implement controller support so that the rumble functionality could be used to allow vision impaired individuals to solve/be guided through simple mazes.  However, we could not get lwjgl, a java library allowing controller support, chosen because it supports rumble better than other options, could not be implemented without rewriting the game functionality from scratch. 

## Future Work
1. Implement the aforementioned controller support
2. Investigate text-to-speech/audio described mazes
